# Pi-Zero-WHI
WIP: LTE/GPS enabled Pi Zero W
Goal: design a modified version of the raspberry pi zero W, which includes lte/gps functionality and the ability to be 
powered by a lipo battery and/or solar cell in order to act as a cheapish leave behind device.

I am currently evalutating the following devices for design inspiration:
